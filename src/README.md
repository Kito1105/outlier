# Running Locally

If you want to run the site locally, you will need a web server. Here is how you can run it using python. In the parent directory of the repository, execute one of the following, depending on your python version:

    [python2]
    python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer

or

    [python3]
    python3 -m http.server

Then the site will be available at:

    http://localhost:8000/outlier/
