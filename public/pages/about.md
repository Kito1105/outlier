### Guide

The clothsography shows most [Outlier](http://www.outlier.cc) releases made in the period from April 2011 to {this.props.endmonth} {this.props.endyear}, and a few from earlier as well.

To focus on certain kinds of items, turn on one or more of the filters from the top left. For example, to see just shirts released in the summer, click on **Filters** and select **Category/Shirts** **Season/Summer**.

Click on an individual item to see details about that product.

The release gap display indicates how many weeks there have been between releases for the selected product or products.
